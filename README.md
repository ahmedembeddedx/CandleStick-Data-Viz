# Candlestick Data Visualization Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Candlestick Data Visualization project! This project focuses on creating an interactive candlestick chart to visualize financial market data. The project is developed by [Ahmed](https://github.com/ahmedembeddedx/). You can find the project repository [here](https://github.com/ahmedembeddedx/CandleStick-Data-Viz).

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of financial market data, including open, close, high, and low prices for a specific asset over a given period. The data is preprocessed to ensure its suitability for candlestick chart visualization.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Financial market data was obtained from a reliable source. Preprocessing steps were implemented to clean and organize the data.

2. **Data Visualization**: The primary focus of the project is on creating an interactive candlestick chart to represent the price movements of the financial asset over time. The chart includes key elements such as open, close, high, and low prices for each time period.

3. **Technical Analysis Indicators**: Additional technical analysis indicators, such as moving averages or RSI, may be incorporated into the chart to provide more insights into market trends.

4. **User Interaction**: The chart is designed to be interactive, allowing users to zoom in, pan, and explore specific time frames with ease.

5. **C++ Implementation**: The project is implemented in C++ to ensure efficient performance and seamless integration with existing financial systems.

6. **Deployment**: The candlestick data visualization tool is deployed as a standalone application, providing users with a powerful tool for analyzing financial market trends.
